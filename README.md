Object-Relational Mapping

## Elevator Pitch

A backend for an ecommerce website using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database 

## Application

1. `mysql -u root -p` to connect to the database 
2. Enter password inside the .env file
3. Source the schema.sql
4. `npm run seed` to seed the file
5. `npm start` to connect to the server

## Future Improvements

Currently getting `TypeError: Cannot read property of 'length' of undefined` when a post is made
